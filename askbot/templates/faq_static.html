<h1>{% trans %}Frequently Asked Questions {% endtrans %}({% trans %}FAQ{% endtrans %})</h1>
<h2 class="first">{% trans %}What kinds of questions can I ask here?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}Most importantly - questions should be <strong>relevant</strong> to this community.{% endtrans %}
{% trans %}Before you ask - please make sure to search for a similar question. You can search questions by their title or tags.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<h2>{% trans %}How does questions, answers and comments work?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans %}This site is for asking and answering questions, not for open-ended discussions.{% endtrans %}
    {% trans %}We encourage everyone to post question for asking and answers for answering; try to avoid asking multiple questions in one post.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans %}Each question and answer can be commented â€“ the comments are good for limited discussions, and to clear up any uncertainties about a question.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<h2>{% trans %}What kinds of questions should be avoided?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}Please avoid asking questions that are not relevant to this community, too subjective and argumentative.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>Also, if you have a specific hardware design you want to have reviewed, or a problem of which you are uncertain of the cause, you may be better off by posting <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/supportcase/create">a regular support case</a>.</p>
<h2>{% trans %}What should I avoid in my answers?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{{ settings.APP_TITLE }} {% trans %}is a <strong>question and answer</strong> site - <strong>it is not a discussion group</strong>. Please avoid holding debates in your answers as they tend to dilute the essense of questions and answers. For the brief discussions please use commenting facility.{% endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{% trans %}Who moderates this community?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}The short answer is: <strong>you</strong>.{% endtrans %}
{% trans %}This website is moderated by the users.{% endtrans %}
{% trans %}Reputation system allows users to earn rights to perform a variety of moderation tasks{% endtrans %}
</p>
<h2>{% trans %}How does reputation system work?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}When a question or answer is upvoted, the user who posted them will gain some points, which are called "reputation points". These points serve as a rough measure of the community trust to him/her. Various moderation tasks are gradually assigned to the users based on those points.{% endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans MAX_REP_GAIN_PER_USER_PER_DAY=settings.MAX_REP_GAIN_PER_USER_PER_DAY, REP_GAIN_FOR_RECEIVING_UPVOTE=settings.REP_GAIN_FOR_RECEIVING_UPVOTE, REP_LOSS_FOR_RECEIVING_DOWNVOTE=settings.REP_LOSS_FOR_RECEIVING_DOWNVOTE|absolute_value %}For example, if you ask an interesting question or give a helpful answer, your input will be upvoted. On the other hand if the answer is misleading - it will be downvoted. Each vote in favor will generate <strong>{{REP_GAIN_FOR_RECEIVING_UPVOTE}}</strong> points, each vote against will subtract <strong>{{REP_LOSS_FOR_RECEIVING_DOWNVOTE}}</strong> points. There is a limit of <strong>{{MAX_REP_GAIN_PER_USER_PER_DAY}}</strong> points that can be accumulated for a question or answer per day. The table below explains reputation point requirements for each type of moderation task.{% endtrans %}
